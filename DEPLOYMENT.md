### 2. Fixed Real-time Connection Issues

#### Backend Changes (`backend/server.js`):
- Enhanced Socket.IO configuration with better timeout settings
- Improved CORS handling for production deployment
- Added health check endpoints for connection monitoring
- Configured proper transport methods (websocket + polling fallback)

#### Frontend Changes:
- Created environment configuration (`frontend/src/config/environment.js`)
- Updated socket connection URLs to work with both local and production environments
- Enhanced connection retry logic with longer timeouts
- Improved error handling for connection failures

#### Components Updated:
- `frontend/src/CommunityChat.jsx`: Better connection handling and status indicators
- `frontend/src/Chatbot.jsx`: Improved socket initialization and reconnection
- `frontend/src/VideoMeetup.jsx`: Enhanced camera initialization and error handling

### 3. Fixed Video Camera Issues

#### Video Meetup Improvements:
- Enhanced media device initialization with better error handling
- Added proper camera permission checks and user-friendly error messages
- Improved video element handling with proper stream attachment
- Added track ended event handlers for better cleanup
- Enhanced video display with proper fallback states

## Deployment Instructions

### Backend Deployment (Render)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Set the following environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string`
   - `JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret`
   - Any other required environment variables

4. Build Command: `npm install`
5. Start Command: `npm start`

### Frontend Deployment (Render)
1. Create a new Static Site
2. Build Command: `npm run build`
3. Publish Directory: `dist`
4. The frontend will automatically detect production environment

### Environment Configuration
The app automatically detects the environment:
- **Development**: Uses `http://localhost:5000` for backend
- **Production**: Uses `https://officepulse-backend.onrender.com` for backend

### Connection Improvements
- Increased socket timeout to 15 seconds for slower connections
- Added polling transport as fallback for websocket issues
- Enhanced reconnection attempts (up to 10 tries)
- Better error messages for connection failures

### Camera/Video Improvements
- Enhanced permission handling with user-friendly error messages
- Better device detection and error reporting
- Improved video stream cleanup to prevent camera staying on
- Added proper video element state management

## Testing
1. Test backend health: `GET /api/health`
2. Test socket health: `GET /api/socket-health`
3. Use browser developer tools to monitor WebSocket connections
4. Check camera permissions in browser settings

## Troubleshooting
- If real-time features show "Reconnecting...", check network connectivity
- For camera issues, ensure browser permissions are granted
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify backend is running and accessible at the configured URL
